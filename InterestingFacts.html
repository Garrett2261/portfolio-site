      <h4 class="card-title">I went to Spain</h4>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>
        I went to Spain when I was a junior in high school. I went with several other students that were in my Spanish class and we went during Spring Break. We went there for 2 weeks. The first week, we traveled together as a group and toured several cities such as Barcelona, Madrid, Bilbao, and Santander. The second week, each of the students stayed with a host family for a week. I really enjoyed my family and cherised each moment I had with them. The Mom and Dad were really nice along with the two brothers. I got a good look at what life was like when I was in Spain. I went to high school with my host brother and I also toured the city, Zaragoza, that they live in.

      <h4 class="card-title">I was born in California</h4>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>
        Another interesting fact that not many people know about me is that I was born in California. I lived there for the first four years of my life. My Mom and Dad met out there and gave birth to my sister and I before we moved to Wisconsin. I occasionally will go back to California to visit my grandparents and cousins that live there.

      <h4 class="card-title">I have been on a cruise</h4>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>
       I went on a cruise for the first time this past summer. I went with my Mom, Dad, and sister. It was a one week cruise in the Western Carribean. We toured many great places such as the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Belize, and Cozumel. We did a lot of fun activities such as cave tubing, snorkeling, laying on the beach, and trying new foods. There was also a lot of fun events on the cruise as well such as going to the pool, themed dinners, group dances, karakoe, and lots more.

      <h4 class="card-title">I have a birthmark on my left wrist</h4>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>
        One part of me that a lot of people notice when they meet me for the first time, or are talking to me is my birthmark. It is located on my left wrist and I have had it ever since I was born. It's a cool feature of mine, and I have joked with friends that it looks like an ice cream cone if you see it.

      <h4 class="card-title">I share the same birthday as Busta Rhymes</h4>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>
        Another cool fact is I have the same birthday as Busta Rhymes. I like some of his music, and it's cool that he and I share the same birthday.

      <h4 class="card-title">I am left handed</h4>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>
       Something else interesting, is the fact that I am left handed. When I do activities such as write, eat, drink, and brush my teeth, I use my left hand. But there are some exceptions such as playing sports. When it comes to sports, I throw with my right hand, catch with my right, hit right-handed, and shoot right-handed.
