        I am a huge sports nut. My favorite sports are football and baseball. When it comes to football I am a huge college football fan, and my favorite team is the Alabama Crimson Tide. My favorite baseball team is the Milwaukee Brewers. I have been to several Alabama football games with my Dad (he went to Alabama and is from there) along with my Mom and sister as well. My Dad's side of the family all graduated from Alabama so Alabama football is in my DNA. I am a big Brewers fan as well. I go to a couple games each year and I really enjoy them. My favorite player is Ryan Braun and I have his jersey as well. I also play sports as well. In high school, I played football and baseball. In football I played defensive line, and in baseball I played 2nd base. Even though I enjoyed both, baseball was my favorite sport to play.
